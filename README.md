# ARKANOID

The player controls the "Vaus", a space vessel that acts as the game's "paddle" which prevents a ball from falling 
from the playing field, and attempts to bounce the ball against a number of bricks. The ball striking a brick causes
the brick to disappear.

It's a simple arcade game mostly built to practice javaScript.
